# Penetration Testing

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Running Linux commands to accomplish desired goals in the project.
- Performing basic scans of a network to identify machines connected on the network.

- Performing port and service scans to identify ports and services running on the machines.
- Interpreting results from port and service scans.

- Ability to find a compromise vector of a system and initiate an attack.
- Skillful in exploring available web pages to identify a good place to attempt some attacks.

*Running commands on a compromized webserver to retrieve user credentials*

- Ability to pivot from one compromized system into other machines on the same network to obtian sensitive data.
- Proficient in searching a webserver for SSH keys, copy the key and establish SSH access to pivot onto a machine.
